## Introduction
Welcome to the Binary Addition Program! This program allows you to perform bitwise addition on two positive numbers, either in binary or decimal format. It displays the bitwise addition results in binary format. The program operates in a loop, continuously reading two positive numbers and displaying their sum until instructed to quit by the user.

## Features
Perform bitwise addition on two positive numbers in binary or decimal format.
Display the sum in binary format.
Error handling for invalid inputs, including numbers outside the specified range, non-numeric entries, and invalid formats.
## Model
Utilizes a single bit adder model and a byte adder model for performing bitwise addition.
Implements logical operations such as OR, AND, and XOR.
## Algorithm
Define functions for logical operations (OR, AND, XOR) and conversion between decimal and binary.
Implement byte adder algorithm for adding two-byte numbers using cascading bit adders.
## Data Structures
Utilizes data structures such as lists, strings, sets, and integers to handle inputs and perform logical operations.
## Program
Developed in Python.
Accepts user inputs for positive numbers in binary or decimal format.
Validates inputs and displays appropriate error messages.
Performs bitwise addition and displays the result in binary format.
## Testing
Tested with normal data, boundary values, wrong data types, and wrong values to ensure robustness.
Observed expected output when inputs are valid and appropriate error messages when inputs are invalid.
## Conclusion
Despite initial confusion and challenges, successfully implemented the Binary Addition Program.
Overcame difficulties in creating functions within loops and understanding certain concepts.
Recognize room for improvement but satisfied with the outcome given the time constraints.
